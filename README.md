As a data enthusiast with a strong educational foundation in data management and statistics, I thrive on crafting data-driven stories. Drawing from my experience writing short stories for the Vertigo Literary Magazine, I understand the power of storytelling in its many forms. Proficient in Python and SQL, I unravel insights from complex datasets and bring them to life through impactful visualizations. With a passion for problem-solving and effective communication, I'm excited to engage with innovative teams and contribute to data-driven decision-making.
